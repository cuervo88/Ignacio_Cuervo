## Web scraper

### Project done to practice web scraping.

Code generated for the simple practice of web scrapping after a conversation with a friend regarding a possible correlation between the star signs and the nobel price winners.

The project can be explored [here](https://github.com/cuervo88/Scrape_nobel_laureates).

Here is just a link to the plot generated with that code.
